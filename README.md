# 40-Daya-DL-MLOps
🚀 40-Day Deep Learning + MLOps Journey | Implementations, notes, and projects based on Hands-On Machine Learning (3rd Ed.). Covers neural nets, CNNs, transfer learning, and MLOps practices like versioning, experiment tracking &amp; deployment.

## Day 1 - First Neural Network (MNIST)

- Built a simple fully connected neural network using TensorFlow & Keras.
- Dataset: MNIST (handwritten digits).
- Model: Flatten → Dense(128, ReLU) → Dense(10, Softmax).
- Achieved ~97% test accuracy.

## Day 2 — Activation Functions
- Compared Sigmoid vs ReLU on MNIST.
- ReLU trained faster and achieved higher accuracy.
- Learned why activation functions introduce non-linearity and prevent collapse into a linear model.
